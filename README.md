### Project Proposal
2017, Victoria reported the highest home burglary rate in Australia.  In 2019, we had harsh bush fire, in 2020 we had the COVID-19 outbreak, and the state was on and off lockdown until the end of September 2021.  In 2022, we gradually have had a more normal life.  With these major changes last few years, there were impacts to our livelihood household wise, income and mental changes, we would like to see how crime and safety changed between 2019 and 2022 in the state of Victoria.

### Police Data
This webpage for offence summary (policedata.html) that is providing a list of the different offence types for each year for each local government area (LGA). This least can be filtered by different fields (Local Government Area and Year). Using the filters on the same page and Plotly, we display a bar chart representing the different offence types for a specific Local Government area for a specific year (both filter has to be selected).  We used various technologies for displaying this data, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, D3 and Plotly (policedata.html, policadata.js, policedata.css).
